CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddynamics_node.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "dynamics_node", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "dynamics_node"
  with any of the following names:

    dynamics_nodeConfig.cmake
    dynamics_node-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "dynamics_node" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "dynamics_node_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "dynamics_node" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
